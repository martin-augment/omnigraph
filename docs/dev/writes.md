# Direct-Publish Write Path

> History: the Run state machine and `__run__<id>` staging branches were
> removed in MR-771 (shipped v0.4.0). Writes now go directly to the target
> table; this document specifies that direct-publish path.

`mutate_as` and `load` prepare against one immutable branch-authority token,
write **directly to the target table**, and call
`ManifestBatchPublisher::publish` once at the end. The token is
`(Lance branch identifier, exact optional graph_head, accepted schema identity)`;
the exact `graph_head` check protects validation dependencies on tables the
write does not touch. Publisher row-level CAS on `__manifest` is the visibility
fence. Process-local branch/table queues reduce retries but are not distributed
authority.

## What this means in practice

- No `RunRecord`, no `_graph_runs.lance`, no `_graph_run_actors.lance`.
- No `omnigraph run *` CLI subcommands and no `/runs/*` HTTP endpoints.
- No `__run__<id>` staging branches; `__run__*` is no longer a reserved
  name. The branch-name guard was removed in MR-770, and any stale
  `__run__*` branch on an upgraded graph is swept off `__manifest` by the
  v2→v3 internal-schema migration on first read-write open. (The inert
  `_graph_runs.lance` bytes remain until a `delete_prefix` primitive lands.)
- Cancelled mutation futures leave **no graph-visible state** unless the
  manifest publish already completed. Before that point they can leave
  reclaimable uncommitted Lance files, or sidecar-covered committed table
  effects that the next quiesced recovery rolls forward/compensates. A
  first-touch named-branch write can also leave a target table ref, but it is
  never created without ownership: the schema-v3 sidecar is durable first and
  names that `(table_path, target ref)`. Reclaim and `cleanup` treat any
  matching pending sidecar as a hard stop. Quiesced full recovery accepts both
  logical crash shapes — sidecar durable with no ref yet, or an exact untouched
  ref at the inherited version. Because Lance creates a branch dataset before
  writing its authoritative `BranchContents`, the first shape may still contain
  a clone-only tree; recovery force-reclaims that absent-ref tree idempotently.
  It removes an exact untouched ref before deleting the empty intent. If several
  pending intents claim one ref, a no-effect intent discards only itself while
  any competitor remains; the last no-effect survivor cleans an untouched ref,
  or the effect-owning survivor recovers normally. `cleanup` remains the
  backstop for genuinely unclaimed legacy/stale refs; see the fork-reclaim note
  in [invariants.md](invariants.md).

## Mutation/load coarse OCC (RFC-022 first adapter)

Mutation and load use a closed prepare → effect → publish attempt:

1. run the branch-aware recovery barrier, then capture the target branch's native Lance
   `BranchIdentifier`, exact `graph_head:<branch>` (including absence on a
   fresh branch), accepted schema identity, and table snapshot;
2. run the complete validator and prepare every effect outside the effect gate.
   Existing-table transactions may stage reclaimable files here. A first-touch
   named-branch table retains its batch/predicate and pre-mints the transaction
   identity instead: Lance branch-local files cannot be staged until its target
   ref exists;
3. acquire the schema gate, branch gate, then sorted table queues; re-check for
   a relevant sidecar armed since step 1, then revalidate the token and require
   every existing physical target's live Lance HEAD to equal its manifest pin.
   Any unresolved relevant intent returns typed `RecoveryRequired`; uncovered
   HEAD drift points to `omnigraph repair`. Both fail before this attempt arms
   recovery;
4. on a pre-effect mismatch, discard the complete attempt. Append/Insert/Merge
   reprepare with a bounded retry; strict Update/Delete/Overwrite return typed
   `ReadSetChanged`;
5. arm a schema-v3 recovery sidecar. For each deferred first-touch table, create
   its target ref, stage branch-local files on that ref, and bind the staged
   transaction to the pre-minted UUID. Then commit every planned transaction
   with zero transparent conflict retries, confirm exact transaction UUIDs and
   table updates, and publish the pre-minted lineage intent under the same token.

The publisher checks the exact head and native branch identity on every CAS
attempt. It never reparents a validation-sensitive intent after contention. A
mismatch after any physical effect returns `RecoveryRequired` and leaves the
sidecar intact; it is not an ordinary retry loop.

This adapter preserves the documented single-writer-process support boundary.
The native branch identifier detects delete/recreate ABA but is not a Lance
conditional-ref fence, and destructive recovery remains unsafe beside a live
foreign process.

### Branch-merge authority and recovery adapter (RFC-022 v4)

Branch merge retains its writer-specific row classifier and multi-commit table
algorithms, but its authority, recovery, and visibility boundary now use the
RFC-022 adapter contract:

1. capture source and target as coherent `WriteTxn` snapshots. The target token
   is `(BranchIdentifier, exact optional graph_head, accepted schema identity)`;
   the effective lineage head is captured separately because a fresh named
   branch can inherit a parent while its own `graph_head:<branch>` row is absent;
2. compute the merge base from those captured commit ids and classify against
   the immutable base/source/target snapshots outside table gates;
3. acquire the conservative all-catalog source/target table envelope, re-list
   recovery intent, revalidate the complete target token, and revalidate the
   source incarnation. Before arming, every existing target ref that will receive
   a physical effect must also have live Lance HEAD equal to its captured target
   manifest pin; the verified handle is carried into the effect instead of being
   reopened. First-touch refs remain absent until after the sidecar. A target
   change returns typed `ReadSetChanged` before effects. A later source-head
   advance is allowed: the contract is "merge the captured source commit," never
   "substitute whatever source is latest";
4. pre-mint the merge lineage and each table's ordered Lance data-transaction
   chain, then arm a schema-v4 BranchMerge sidecar before the first HEAD advance
   or first-touch table ref. Logical data steps commit with those exact
   `(read_version, uuid)` identities and zero transparent conflict retries. Its
   physical-effect set can be smaller than its intended manifest delta:
   pointer-only table updates are still recorded so recovery publishes the
   complete logical merge;
5. after every multi-commit table effect completes, confirm exact final table
   versions, every logical `SubTableUpdate`, and every first-touch target
   `BranchIdentifier`; then publish once with `ExactGraphHead` and the captured
   table expectations.

Publisher retries cannot re-parent the prepared merge onto a newer target. Any
failure after the v4 sidecar is durable returns `RecoveryRequired`. Full recovery
rolls confirmed effects forward only while the captured target authority still
matches; otherwise it compensates the owned effects while preserving the target
winner, or fails closed when foreign/interleaved table state makes compensation
unverifiable. An Armed first-touch ref with no data HEAD movement is reclaimed
without manufacturing rollback lineage. Armed recovery accepts only a
contiguous prefix of the pre-minted data chain. Rebuildable `CreateIndex`
transactions may follow only the complete chain and are rollback-discardable
derived state; any other, unreadable, or non-contiguous transaction fails
closed. A compensating Lance `Restore` is also recognized by its exact target so
a crash after restore but before the manifest publish resumes without restoring
again.

The handle-local coordinator swap and `merge_exclusive` mutex remain an
implementation detail until target-context extraction lands; neither is treated
as persistent authority. Native ref create/delete still lack conditional CAS, so
first-touch destructive recovery retains the documented single-writer-process
boundary. `sync_branch` continues to join the schema gate and cannot replace the
temporary coordinator during a merge.

### Branch-delete orphaning exception

Branch deletion runs the healer first and then holds schema, the target branch,
and every accepted-catalog table gate through the native ref removal. An
unresolved sidecar scoped to that target does not permanently block deletion:
once those gates prove its in-process owner is no longer live, removing the
manifest branch makes its physical effects unreachable. The next write/open
records the orphan-discard recovery audit and deletes the sidecar. A
`SchemaApply` sidecar remains graph-global and blocks deletion. This exception
is specific to removing the authority that made the intent reachable; create,
merge, mutation, and load still reject relevant unresolved ownership.

### Native graph-branch control recovery

Graph branch create/delete do not use the graph-visible table-effect sidecar or
emit graph lineage. Their sole logical authority is Lance `BranchContents` for
the `__manifest` dataset, and Lance mutates that authority in two physical
phases:

- create shallow-clones `tree/{branch}` before writing `BranchContents`;
- delete removes `BranchContents` before reclaiming that tree.

Under the schema/branch/table control gates, create validates the name before
the clone and rejects a live graph name that is a physical path ancestor or
descendant of another live name. It then force-reclaims any absent-ref same-name
tree and performs at most two native attempts. An ambiguous result is accepted
only when fresh metadata has
the captured parent branch/version/incarnation plus exactly one new identifier
element and the target opens. Foreign or broken authoritative refs are never
deleted. Delete captures the exact target identifier; after an ambiguous error,
an absent ref is logical success, the same identifier preserves the original
error, and a different identifier is a typed delete/recreate conflict. Derived
tree cleanup is retried best-effort.

There is deliberately no branch-control sidecar: within the supported
single-writer-process topology, an absent ref makes a same-name tree unreachable
garbage; the path-prefix-disjoint namespace is what makes Lance's recursive
force cleanup exact. Same-name create is therefore the targeted reconciler.
First-touch data-table
forks remain sidecar-owned because they are physical effects of a graph-visible
mutation/load. Lance does not expose conditional ref create/delete, so this
classifier is not advertised as a cross-process branch-control fence.

Legacy prefix-overlap recovery is the one first-touch case that does not prove an
entire nested tree unreachable. If a Full sweep finds an ancestor first-touch
target with a live path-child, it keeps the sidecar. Open may complete for
leaf-first deletion only when the sidecar owns no physical table effect. A mixed
attempt that owns an effect plus an untouched fork must roll back as one recovery
outcome, so open fails closed while the child blocks fork cleanup. After an
existing handle or an offline Lance-level branch tool removes the child, a later
Full sweep reclaims the untouched fork, compensates the owned effect, and retires
the intent.

## Read-your-writes within a multi-statement mutation

A `.gq` query with multiple ops (e.g. `insert Person … insert Knows …`)
must observe earlier ops' writes when validating later ops (referential
integrity, edge cardinality). After MR-794 step 2+ this is implemented
via an in-memory `MutationStaging` accumulator in
[`crates/omnigraph/src/exec/staging.rs`](../../crates/omnigraph/src/exec/staging.rs),
shared by both `mutate_as` and the bulk loader:

- On the first touch of each table, the pre-write manifest version is
  captured into `expected_versions[table_key]` (the publisher's CAS
  fence at end-of-query).
- Each insert/update op pushes a `RecordBatch` into the per-table
  pending accumulator. Lance HEAD does **not** advance during op
  execution.
- Read sites (validation, predicate matching for `update`) consume
  `TableStore::scan_with_pending`, which scans committed via Lance
  and applies the same SQL filter to the pending batches via DataFusion
  `MemTable`. Same-query writes are visible to subsequent reads.
- Blob-bearing updates use the materializing variant: Lance reads only matched
  committed blob payloads as binary, the engine normalizes them back to the
  logical blob schema, and the full rows join the same pending-shadow union.
  Rewriting matched blob bytes costs I/O proportional to those bytes, but makes
  correctness independent of whether a physical index selects a different
  Lance merge plan.
- At end-of-query, `MutationStaging::stage_all` prepares exactly one staged
  transaction per touched table and `commit_all` commits it (concatenating accumulated
  batches; merge-mode dedupes by `id`, last-write-wins), and the publisher
  publishes the manifest atomically across all touched sub-tables. Existing
  tables stage before gate acquisition; a first-touch named-branch table stages
  after sidecar + fork under the gates so its uncommitted files live in the
  correct Lance branch tree. Cross-table conflicts surface as typed read-set or
  manifest conflicts.
- **Deletes stage too (MR-A).** Lance 7.0's
  `DeleteBuilder::execute_uncommitted` (#6658) makes delete a two-phase op,
  so deletes no longer inline-commit. Each delete records a predicate in
  `MutationStaging.delete_predicates`; at end-of-query `stage_all` combines a
  table's predicates into one `stage_delete` (a deletion-vector transaction,
  no HEAD advance) committed through the same `commit_staged` path as writes.
  A predicate matching zero rows stages nothing — no inline residual, and the
  zero-row drift class is closed by construction. The parse-time D₂ rule
  (below) still prevents inserts/updates from coexisting with deletes in one
  query.

This upholds the manifest-atomic mutation and read-your-writes invariants
tracked in [docs/dev/invariants.md](invariants.md).

### D₂ — parse-time mixed-mode rejection

A single mutation query is either insert/update-only or delete-only.
Mixed → rejected at parse time with a clear error directing the user to
split the query. This is a deliberate boundary, not a temporary limitation.
Inserts/updates accumulate as pending batches and deletes as predicates, and
both stage correctly; keeping a single query to one kind means read-your-writes
within that query stays unambiguous (a read never reconciles pending inserts
against same-query delete predicates) and each touched table commits at most one
version. Compose mixed operations by issuing separate atomic mutations (writes,
then deletes), or a branch + merge for one atomic commit. Allowing mixing would
instead require an in-query delete view, pending pruning, and per-table
two-commit ordering in the hot mutation path — complexity this boundary
deliberately avoids.

### MR-793 status (storage trait two-phase invariant) — complete

MR-793 hoists the staged-write pattern into a `TableStorage` trait
surface with sealed-trait enforcement and opaque `SnapshotHandle` /
`StagedHandle` types — see `crates/omnigraph/src/storage_layer.rs`.
The trait is the canonical surface for new engine code; existing call
sites route graph-visible effects through it. Capability and statistics
surfaces for planner decisions remain separate roadmap work.

Three writers have been migrated onto staged primitives:

* **`ensure_indices`** (`db/omnigraph/table_ops.rs::ensure_indices_for_branch`)
  — a typed `stage_create_indices` request combines every missing BTree,
  Inverted/FTS, and full-table vector artifact for one table into one Lance
  `Operation::CreateIndex`, followed by one `commit_staged_exact`. Which index a
  `@index`/`@key` property gets is dispatched by type via
  `node_prop_index_kind` (enum + orderable scalar → BTree, free-text String →
  Inverted/FTS, Vector → vector). This build is
  existence-gated (it creates a *missing* index over current fragments); folding
  fragments appended afterward into an *existing* index is `optimize`'s
  `optimize_indices` pass — an inline-commit residual, not a staged write (Lance
  exposes no uncommitted index-optimize), covered by the optimize recovery
  sidecar (see [maintenance.md](../user/operations/maintenance.md)).
* **`branch_merge::publish_rewritten_merge_table`**
  (`exec/merge.rs`) — merge_insert now uses `stage_merge_insert` +
  `commit_staged`; its deletes use `stage_delete` + `commit_staged` (MR-A).
* **`schema_apply` rewritten_tables** (`db/omnigraph/schema_apply.rs`)
  — rewrites use `stage_overwrite` + `commit_staged`, including empty-table
  rewrites via a zero-fragment Lance `Operation::Overwrite`.

Rust visibility is the primary graph-write boundary: the raw storage,
handle-cache, and coordinator modules are crate-private. Public snapshot access
returns a read-only table facade rather than Lance's writable `Dataset`, and its
scan facade executes the configured read without exposing Lance's raw `Scanner`
or physical plan (a scan execution node can otherwise reveal its dataset). A
defense-in-depth integration test (`tests/forbidden_apis.rs`) walks engine source
and rejects known direct Lance open/inline-commit shapes outside exact gateway
files. It classifies public async inherent `Omnigraph` methods and loader
conveniences, every crate-visible async coordinator method, and exact per-file
occurrences of registered durable-call shapes, including recovery. Its
syntax-tree checks cover the concrete method/UFCS/raw-Dataset and selected
rename/macro forms pinned by scanner self-tests; they are deliberately not a
substitute for Rust visibility or a claim to expand arbitrary macros and
function-pointer aliases. A new supported writer or durable gateway is therefore
an explicit registry change rather than an accidental call site.

The `failpoints` Cargo feature retains one doc-hidden, registry-classified
`TestOnly` manifest-publish helper for adversarial integration fixtures. It is
an explicit non-production exception: enabling failpoints already opts into
fault-injection behavior and is outside the supported SDK surface.

The "finalize → publisher residual" described below applies equally to
the migrated writers — Lance has no multi-dataset atomic commit primitive, so
the per-table `commit_staged` → manifest-publish gap is the same drift class.
The shipped sidecar recovery protocol closes that gap.

### The storage surface has no inline-commit residual

MR-793's acceptance criterion §1 ("`TableStore` (or successor) public API has
no method that performs a manifest commit as a side effect of writing") now
holds more narrowly **by construction**: `TableStore` / `TableStorage` are
crate-private, and their internal `db.storage()` surface exposes only staged
primitives + reads. Lance 7.0's `DeleteBuilder::execute_uncommitted`
([#6658](https://github.com/lance-format/lance/issues/6658)) moved delete to
`stage_delete`; beta.21's full-table index `execute_uncommitted` shape moved the
last vector build into `stage_create_indices`. `InlineCommitResidual`,
`storage_inline_residual()`, and inline `create_vector_index` are removed.
Generic multi-segment exact index publication remains covered by Lance
[#6666](https://github.com/lance-format/lance/issues/6666), but it is not used by
the current one-segment full-table shape.

`SnapshotHandle`'s Lance field is private. The few crate-private raw accessors
remain only for enumerated read/maintenance bridges and are exact-counted by the
same conformance guard. In particular, only Optimize's two physical compaction
paths take mutable Dataset ownership; read-only planning, repair classification,
cleanup enumeration/GC, export, and blob access use registered borrows/handles.
Adding another extraction changes its registered count and fails the guard
rather than silently reopening a data-write side door.

The parse-time D₂ rule remains a deliberate boundary (constructive XOR
destructive per query), not residual scaffolding. The
`tests/forbidden_apis.rs` guard catches direct `lance::*` inline-commit misuse
outside the storage layer and also pins the retired residual symbols absent.

### `LoadMode::Overwrite` uses staged Lance `Overwrite`

The bulk loader's Append, Merge, and Overwrite modes all use the
staged-write path described above. `LoadMode::Overwrite` accumulates
replacement batches in memory, validates node/edge constraints, referential
integrity, and edge cardinality before any Lance HEAD movement, stages
each touched table with Lance `Operation::Overwrite`, then runs
`commit_staged` under the normal `SidecarKind::Load` recovery sidecar
before publishing `__manifest`. `OMNIGRAPH_LOAD_CONCURRENCY` applies to the
fragment-writing stage only; the commit and manifest publish run while holding
the root-shared schema → branch → sorted-table gates. Empty-table overwrite is
represented as a valid zero-fragment Lance `Overwrite` transaction, not as
truncate-then-append.

### Open-time recovery sweep

The staged-write rewire eliminates one drift class **by construction at
the writer layer**: an op that fails before pushing to the in-memory
accumulator (validation errors, missing endpoints, parse-time D₂
rejection) leaves Lance HEAD untouched on every staged table. This is
the case the `partial_failure_leaves_target_queryable_and_unblocks_next_mutation`
test pins.

A second, narrower drift class — the **finalize → publisher window** —
is closed across one open cycle by the open-time recovery sweep:

`MutationStaging::stage_all` prepares the table transactions and `commit_all`
runs their independent HEAD advances before the publisher commits the manifest. Lance has
no multi-dataset atomic commit, so the per-table `commit_staged` calls
are independent operations: if commit_staged on table N+1 fails *after*
commit_staged on tables 1..N succeeded, or if the publisher's CAS
pre-check rejects *after* every commit_staged succeeded, tables 1..N
are left at `Lance HEAD = manifest_pinned + 1`.

**Recovery protocol** (lifecycle of every staged-write writer —
`MutationStaging::commit_all`, `schema_apply::apply_schema_with_lock`,
`branch_merge_on_current_target`, `ensure_indices_for_branch`,
`optimize_all_tables`):

Before Phase A, under the writer's final schema → branch → table gates, existing
physical targets must still match their manifest pins. Ahead drift is never folded
or claimed by manufacturing a new sidecar; it is attributed to an existing recovery
intent or refused with explicit `omnigraph repair` guidance. First-touch targets use
the separate sidecar-before-ref protocol. SchemaApply also verifies that AddType and
RenameType target dataset paths are absent, so recovery cannot register an orphan or
foreign dataset as if this apply created it.

1. **Phase A**: writer writes a sidecar JSON to
   `__recovery/{ulid}.json` BEFORE its first independently durable physical
   effect (including a first-touch Lance branch ref) or HEAD-advancing commit
   (`commit_staged`, or `compact_files` for `optimize_all_tables`,
   which advances the Lance HEAD via a reserve-fragments + rewrite
   commit rather than a staged write). The
   sidecar names every `(table_key, table_path, expected_version,
   post_commit_pin)` it intends to commit + the writer kind +
   actor_id.
   For a first-touch named-branch Mutation/Load table, Phase A is followed by
   target-ref creation and branch-local `stage_*`; the schema-v3 sidecar already
   carries its pre-minted transaction identity. Branch merge uses schema v4:
   it distinguishes multi-commit HEAD effects from ref-only forks, records each
   multi-commit effect's ordered exact transaction chain, and records the
   complete intended manifest delta, including pointer-only slots. SchemaApply
   uses schema v7: it captures the main native branch identity, exact optional
   graph head, accepted schema identity, fixed original lineage + initiating
   actor, and fixed rollback id. Every existing-table overwrite and AddType /
   RenameType first-touch create has one pre-minted Lance transaction identity;
   the latter is a strict read-version-zero create. The sidecar also carries the
   complete registration/update/tombstone delta, including metadata-only applies
   whose table-effect set is empty. Readers retain the old schema-v5 target-hash
   + Phase-C-confirmation bridge semantics for files written by older binaries;
   v5 table effects remain loose and are never reinterpreted as v7. EnsureIndices
   uses schema v8: it captures native branch + graph-head + schema authority,
   fixed original and rollback lineage, one pre-minted mixed CreateIndex
   transaction per touched table, and the complete table-pointer delta. A
   first-touch effect also records its inherited source version and later binds
   the exact created ref identity. Readers retain schema-v6 EnsureIndices files
   as a narrow compatibility bridge under their original loose classification
   and fixed-rollback semantics; v6 is never reinterpreted as v8 ownership.
2. **Phase B**: writer's per-table `commit_staged` loop runs.
   - **Phase-B confirmation:** a schema-v4 `BranchMerge` writer
     advances each table's HEAD by *several* exact commits (append → upsert →
     delete). Recovery proves a contiguous prefix of the pre-armed transaction
     chain rather than inferring ownership from numeric HEAD movement. After the
     whole per-table loop finishes, the writer atomically confirms each exact
     achieved version, the complete logical manifest delta, and first-touch ref
     identities, then proceeds to Phase C. Schema-v3 Mutation/Load sidecars also confirm: each table must
     match the staged Lance transaction's `(read_version, uuid)`, and the
     sidecar records the exact `SubTableUpdate` plus original lineage intent.
     This is the commit point of the recovery WAL: a crash *after* confirmation
     rolls forward only when the captured branch token still matches; a crash
     *during* Phase B (sidecar still unconfirmed) rolls back. Schema-v7
     SchemaApply follows the same boundary with writer-specific effects: exact
     `Overwrite` for an existing table and exact version-one `Create` for a new
     target path, all committed with zero transparent conflict retries. After
     every achieved identity/version and all schema staging files are durable,
     it confirms the complete registration/update/tombstone delta and moves
     `Armed → EffectsConfirmed`. Schema-v8 EnsureIndices likewise requires one
     exact achieved transaction at `read_version + 1` per table, binds every
     first-touch ref identity, confirms the complete table-pointer delta, and
     only then moves `Armed → EffectsConfirmed`. Optimize's bounded schema-v2
     adapter intentionally has no exact confirmation boundary.
3. **Phase C**: publisher commits the manifest.
4. **Phase D**: writer deletes the sidecar.

A failure between Phase A and Phase D leaves the sidecar on disk. The
next `Omnigraph::open` (gated on `OpenMode::ReadWrite`) runs the
recovery sweep in `crates/omnigraph/src/db/manifest/recovery.rs`:

- For each sidecar in `__recovery/`, compare every named table's
  Lance HEAD to the manifest pin. Classify per the all-or-nothing
  decision tree (RolledPastExpected / NoMovement / UnexpectedAtP1 /
  UnexpectedMultistep / IncompletePhaseB / InvariantViolation). For a
  legacy `BranchMerge` sidecar, a moved HEAD with no `confirmed_version`
  classifies as `IncompletePhaseB` (a partial multi-commit publish) and forces
  roll-back; with a `confirmed_version`, roll-forward targets exactly that
  version. Schema-v4 BranchMerge recovery additionally requires the captured
  target token, fixed original/rollback lineage ids, the exact ordered data
  transaction chains, exact confirmed physical effects, first-touch ref
  identities, and the complete confirmed manifest delta. A changed target token
  is rollback-only and can never re-parent the merge onto the winner. Recovery
  refuses a foreign or non-contiguous transaction instead of restoring through
  it, and recognizes an already-landed exact compensation restore on restart.
  Schema-v3 Mutation/Load additionally requires `EffectsConfirmed`, the exact
  Lance transaction identity at the confirmed version, the original immutable
  manifest delta, and a matching captured authority token. A changed token is
  rollback-only; an unknown/foreign effect is refused rather than adopted.
  Schema-v7 SchemaApply applies the same exact-ownership rule to each existing
  overwrite and first-touch create, and additionally binds accepted + target
  schema identities, fixed original/rollback lineage, the initiating actor, and
  its complete registration/update/tombstone delta. `Armed` is rollback-only;
  `EffectsConfirmed` can roll forward only when every achieved transaction and
  output matches and the captured main authority is still live. A disjoint
  authority winner is preserved while recovery compensates only owned effects.
  If foreign movement buries an owned same-table effect, recovery fails closed
  with the sidecar intact instead of restoring through or adopting the winner.
  Schema-v8 EnsureIndices applies the exact rule to each one-transaction mixed
  index batch: the observed transaction UUID/read version and achieved
  `expected + 1` version must match the plan, `EffectsConfirmed` must carry the
  complete fixed table-pointer delta, and a first-touch named branch must retain
  the confirmed Lance ref identity. Changed authority is rollback-only; a
  foreign or buried index commit is never adopted or restored through. Schema-v6
  files continue through the old loose classifier rather than being upgraded in
  place.
  First-touch rollback deletes only the exact owned version-one dataset and only
  while no manifest registration or competing recovery claim owns the path. A
  foreign winner at an unregistered first-touch path is left untouched and is
  never adopted; recovery can still roll back this attempt's other owned effects.
  An Armed first-touch intent with no owned transaction is deferred by live
  roll-forward-only healing because another handle may still own it. Quiesced
  full recovery tolerates an absent target ref (either crash before clone or a
  clone-only tree with no `BranchContents`) and force-reclaims that absent-ref
  target idempotently. If an authoritative ref exists, recovery removes it only
  when it is exactly unchanged and no other pending sidecar claims it. With
  competing claims, the current no-effect sidecar discards itself without
  touching the ref; the final survivor owns cleanup/recovery.
  During partial rollback, no-effect refs are removed before the rollback
  outcome is published so a retry cannot strand them. If a legacy live
  path-child blocks that cleanup, rollback returns an error and read-write open
  fails closed; only a sidecar proven to own no table effect may defer cleanup
  while returning an open handle.
- If any table is `InvariantViolation` (Lance HEAD < manifest pinned —
  should be impossible), **abort** with a loud error and leave the
  sidecar on disk for operator review.
- Otherwise, if every table is `RolledPastExpected`, **roll forward**:
  a single `ManifestBatchPublisher::publish` call extends every pin
  atomically. For schema-v7 SchemaApply, the exact fixed manifest outcome lands
  first; only then does the writer or recovery promote the matching staged
  source/IR/state contract. A crash after one or two renames is completed by
  proving that fixed commit + delta visible and validating every remaining/live
  file against the same target identity. Schema-v5 bridge files retain their
  older confirmation-and-live-target recovery rule.
- Read-only open performs this check without repairing anything: it may serve an
  unpublished v7 attempt against the old manifest/schema pair, but it returns
  `RecoveryRequired` when the fixed original manifest outcome is visible and the
  target schema identity is not yet fully live. A read-write open completes it.
- On a live handle, query, export, graph-index, and blob-read capture takes the
  process-local schema gate just long enough to bind one manifest snapshot to one
  immutable catalog rebuilt from the accepted contract. It never trusts the
  handle's warm ArcSwap after another handle may have applied a schema. Execution
  releases the gate and continues on that captured pair, so a long query does not
  block the whole schema apply. The gate does not serialize a long-lived reader
  in another process; that topology still requires the distributed
  schema-publication fence described in the known gaps.
- Otherwise **roll back**: per-table `Dataset::restore` to the
  manifest-pinned table version, then a single `ManifestBatchPublisher::publish`
  of the restored HEAD — symmetric with roll-forward, so `manifest == HEAD`
  after recovery (no residual drift). This convergence is what lets a
  failed-then-retried schema apply succeed instead of failing one version higher
  each iteration. The audit row's `to_version` records the logical
  rolled-back-to version (`manifest_pinned`); the manifest is published at the
  restore commit (`manifest_pinned + 1`, same content).
- After a successful roll-forward or roll-back, an internal
  `_graph_commit_recoveries.lance` row records `recovery_kind`,
  `recovery_for_actor` (the original sidecar's actor), `operation_id`, and
  exact per-table outcomes. Schema-v3 Mutation/Load, schema-v4 BranchMerge,
  schema-v7 SchemaApply, and schema-v8 EnsureIndices roll-forward publish the
  interrupted writer's fixed lineage intent, including its original actor.
  Schema-v7/v8 rollback reuse their pre-minted recovery commit ids and durable
  audit plans, with the recovery actor. Schema-v6 EnsureIndices files retain
  that compatibility behavior under their original loose classification.
  Other rollback and legacy recovery commits use
  `actor_id = "omnigraph:recovery"`. Ordinary
  commit history is therefore not a complete recovery enumeration, and the
  CLI currently has no public query for the recovery-audit table.
- Sidecar deleted as the final step.

Triggers for the residual: transient Lance write errors during finalize
(object-store retry budget exhaustion, disk full); persistent publisher
contention exceeding `PUBLISHER_RETRY_BUDGET = 5` retries.

**Long-running servers**: the write entry points (`load_as`,
`mutate_as`, `apply_schema_as`, `branch_merge_as`) and
`Omnigraph::refresh` run roll-forward-only recovery in-process
(`recovery::heal_pending_sidecars_roll_forward`) — the common
Phase B → Phase C residual closes on the next write, without a
restart and without an explicit refresh. The heal lists `__recovery/`
(one `list_dir`; empty in the steady state) and, per sidecar, acquires
schema → branch → sorted-table gates that overlap the writer's guarded
sidecar lifetime. RFC-022 mutation/load writers hold the complete order. Branch
merge holds schema plus source/target branch authority for its whole attempt and
then the all-catalog source/target table envelope. SchemaApply holds schema → main
branch → every live table; EnsureIndices holds schema → target branch → every table
in its durable work plan. SchemaApply's schema-v7 payload is its full exact adapter:
it holds fixed authority/lineage and exact table identities from arm through one
`ExactGraphHead` publish, including an empty effect set for metadata-only changes.
Its owned first-touch cleanup and partial-table rollback happen only during Full
recovery; the in-process healer remains roll-forward-only. Schema-v5 remains a
backward-compatible bridge reader, not the current writer. EnsureIndices' current
schema-v8 payload holds fixed authority/lineage, one exact mixed-index transaction
per table, the complete manifest delta, and exact first-touch ownership from arm
through one `ExactGraphHead` publish. `Armed` is rollback-only;
`EffectsConfirmed` rolls forward only while the captured authority still matches.
Schema-v6 files remain backward-compatible bridge inputs with their original loose
classification and fixed rollback plan. Optimize uses bounded schema-v2 effect
provenance with one graph-wide visibility envelope. Its entry recovery probe is
a fast path; it then acquires schema → main branch → every accepted-catalog table gate,
loads one operation-local accepted catalog, relists recovery, and plans productive work
from one fresh snapshot. All productive tables share one multi-pin Optimize sidecar;
their compact/reindex/index-create effects remain bounded-parallel, but no task publishes
or deletes recovery independently. After every effect settles, one maintenance-class
monotonic batch CAS publishes every still-needed pointer and one lineage commit. A
pointer already at or beyond Optimize's achieved version is converged and omitted rather
than forcing strict graph-head OCC. Any post-arm error returns `RecoveryRequired` and
leaves the shared intent for all-or-nothing v2 recovery. Main remains held through final
physical-only `__manifest` compaction so a new main recovery intent cannot arm before raw
manifest movement finishes. The v2 loose classification has no exact
transaction/authority/fixed-lineage proof and therefore stays within the documented
single-writer-process recovery model. Replacing it with exact provenance is deferred
until Lance exposes a stable public caller-controlled transaction API for the complete
compact/reindex operation and OmniGraph has distributed recovery ownership or fencing;
transaction identity alone would not make destructive cross-process recovery safe.
The manager is shared by every
`Omnigraph` handle for one canonical local root identity (relative, absolute,
and symlink aliases converge; object-store/custom schemes stay opaque), so this
also serializes a refresh or separately-opened handle against a live writer instead of rolling its
in-flight sidecar forward from under it (a sidecar whose queues can be
acquired belongs to a writer that finished or died; an existence
re-check after the wait skips the finished case). Lock order is
schema → branch → sorted tables → coordinator, matching the writer effect path.
Mutation/load, branch merge, SchemaApply, and EnsureIndices perform one additional
`list_dir` after acquiring their authority gates; that final check closes the
pre-gate recovery TOCTOU without moving validation or reclaimable staged-file
construction under the gate. Optimize's separate final `list_dir` runs under the
main branch gate because even table-disjoint main intents share graph-head authority.
Pinned by the four
`tests/failpoints.rs::*_after_finalize_publisher_failure_heals_without_reopen`
tests (load, mutation, schema apply, branch merge). The maintenance
entries need the heal for more than liveness: without it, a schema
apply re-plans rewrites from the manifest pin and orphans the drifted
Phase-B commit (dropping its rows), and a branch merge publishes the
drift as an unattributed side effect — both while the stale sidecar
lingers to misclassify later.
Sidecars that would require a `Dataset::restore` (mixed / unexpected
state) are deferred to the next `OpenMode::ReadWrite` open. Full open-time
recovery uses the same root-scoped ordered gates and post-wait existence check,
so it cannot Restore/delete under a live writer owned by another handle in the
same process. Restore remains unsafe across processes because Lance's
`check_restore_txn` accepts
the restore against in-flight Append/Update/Delete commits and
silently orphans them (pinned by
`src/table_store/staged_tests.rs::lance_restore_loses_to_concurrent_append_via_orphaning`).
When such a deferred sidecar blocks a write, the commit-time drift
guard says so explicitly ("a pending recovery sidecar requires
rollback — reopen the graph read-write") instead of pointing at
`omnigraph repair`, which refuses while a sidecar is pending.
`cleanup` refuses pending sidecars at entry as well, before orphan reconciliation
or version GC: v3/v4 ownership and compensation recovery may need the retained
Lance transaction/version history, so garbage collection cannot outrun the
recovery barrier.
Continuous in-process recovery for the rollback path is the goal of a
future background reconciler. `ensure_indices` does not heal at entry itself;
it is an explicit maintenance/reconciliation call, separate from mutation,
load, and schema apply, and its strict preconditions fail loudly on drift.

For enrolled mutation/load, branch merge, SchemaApply, and EnsureIndices, the publisher rechecks the
attempt's exact native branch identity and `graph_head` as well as table
expectations. A
concurrent graph commit anywhere on the target branch therefore invalidates the
prepared authority instead of silently reparenting it. Before effects, an
insert-only mutation or Append/Merge load fully reprepares with a bounded retry; strict
Update/Delete/Overwrite and branch merge return `ReadSetChanged`; after any
effect, any later error returns `RecoveryRequired` and leaves the fixed v3/v4/v7/v8
intent durable. SchemaApply does not transparently reprepare after arming: a lost
authority token is resolved by exact recovery, preserving a disjoint winner or
failing closed on a buried same-table effect. EnsureIndices follows the same rule
without transparent post-arm reprepare. Optimize instead uses the bounded schema-v2
maintenance arbitration described above; its exact-provenance upgrade is deferred
behind the upstream transaction-API and distributed-fencing triggers.

**Sidecar I/O failure semantics** (all sidecar I/O goes through the
backend-generic `StorageAdapter`; the contracts below are pinned by the
storage-fault failpoints `recovery.sidecar_{write,delete,list}` /
`recovery.record_audit` and their tests in `tests/failpoints.rs` and
`tests/recovery.rs`):

- **Phase A put fails** (S3 PutObject / fs write): the writer aborts
  before its first HEAD-advancing commit — no sidecar, no drift,
  nothing to recover; a transient fault never wedges later writes.
- **Phase D delete fails** (S3 DeleteObject): swallowed with a warning —
  the write already published, so failing the caller would report an
  error for a durable write. The stale sidecar is consumed by the next
  write's entry heal (or the next open) via the stale-sidecar
  audit-recovery path, recorded as `RolledForward`.
- **`__recovery/` list fails** (S3 ListObjectsV2): loud at every
  consumer — the write-entry heal fails the write, the open-time sweep
  fails the open. Silently skipping recovery would be consumer
  tolerance of drift.
- **Corrupt / unparseable sidecar**: refused loudly by heal and read-write
  open; the file stays on disk for operator inspection. Read-only open keeps
  its historical tolerance when no schema staging exists, but returns
  `RecoveryRequired` when any schema-staging artifact is present because the
  malformed intent may be the only proof of a committed-but-unpromoted
  SchemaApply.
- **Legacy schema-v5 SchemaApply sidecar**: read-only open admits only the
  provably completed residue (`schema_apply_manifest_published = true` and the
  target schema identity already live). Marker-false or target-mismatched v5
  intents still return `RecoveryRequired`; they need the mutable legacy
  recovery path.
- **Audit append fails after a roll-forward publish**: that recovery
  attempt errors and keeps the sidecar; re-entry sees the
  already-published manifest, records exactly one `RolledForward`
  audit row, and deletes the sidecar (the retry tolerance documented
  on `record_audit`).

Backend notes (the adapter is one implementation over `object_store`
for every backend): local writes stage through `name#<digits>` temp
files that the backend filters from listings and refuses to address —
crash residue of that shape is invisible to the sweep, harmless, and
reclaimed by `delete_prefix`/manual cleanup. Storage errors are
backend-wrapped text without a typed NotFound discriminant — callers
that need missing-vs-error (the cluster store) probe `exists()` first.
`exists()` itself is object-store semantics everywhere: only objects
(or non-empty prefixes) exist, and a permission failure is a loud
error, not a silent `false`.

## Conflict shape

For mutation/load, a changed authority detected before effects is
`ManifestConflictDetails::ReadSetChanged { member, expected, actual }`.
Retryable Insert/Merge/Append attempts handle this internally by fully
repreparing; strict writes surface **409 Conflict** with structured
`read_set_conflict` details. A changed authority discovered after a physical
effect, or any unresolved overlapping intent found at the synchronous recovery
barrier, is `OmniError::RecoveryRequired { operation_id, … }`, mapped to **503
Service Unavailable** with structured `recovery_required`; retry only after the
sidecar has been resolved. Legacy, not-yet-enrolled writers may still surface
`ExpectedVersionMismatch` and `manifest_conflict`.

## Commit actor history

`actor_id` lands in the graph commit lineage — the `graph_commit` rows in
`__manifest`, written in the publish CAS (RFC-013 Phase 7; previously
`_graph_commits.lance`). Ordinary commit/actor history is queried via
`omnigraph commit list`. Crash-recovery actions additionally live in the internal
`_graph_commit_recoveries.lance` table described above; that exact recovery log
does not yet have a public CLI query.

## Storage versioning (no in-place migration)

`db/manifest/migrations.rs` is the single place the on-disk `__manifest` shape is
reconciled with what the binary expects. Storage is **strict-single-version** (the
strand model): this binary reads exactly ONE internal-schema version
(`MIN_SUPPORTED == CURRENT == 4`), so there is no in-place migration.

- **Graph creation** stamps `omnigraph:internal_schema_version` at CURRENT, so a
  fresh graph always opens.
- **`Omnigraph::open`** (both read-write and read-only) reads main's stamp before
  the coordinator reads any branch state and calls `refuse_if_stamp_unsupported`:
  a stamp *below* CURRENT is refused with a rebuild-via-export/import message; a
  stamp *above* CURRENT is refused with "upgrade omnigraph". The publisher
  re-checks the stamp on its write path against the branch it targets, with no
  object-store writes, so the check is safe under a read-only open.
- The stamp + `refuse_if_stamp_unsupported` floor is the only seam a future
  in-place migration would re-introduce (re-add a dispatcher and lower
  `MIN_SUPPORTED`). Until a concrete graph demands it, that machinery is
  deliberately absent — see [versioning.md](versioning.md) (the compatibility
  policy) and [the upgrade guide](../user/operations/upgrade.md) (the rebuild
  recipe).

The stamp history (v1 PK-less, v2 unenforced-PK, v3 `__run__*` sweep, v4 lineage
in `__manifest` with the commit-graph tables retired) is recorded on the
`INTERNAL_MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` doc-comment; only v4 is served. An earlier-stamped
graph is rebuilt via export/import, not migrated in place.

## Mid-query partial failure: closed by MR-794

The pre-MR-794 design had a known limitation: a multi-statement `.gq`
mutation where op-N inline-committed a Lance fragment and op-N+1 then
failed left the touched table at `Lance HEAD = manifest_version + 1`,
blocking the next mutation with `ExpectedVersionMismatch`.

MR-794 (step 1 + step 2+) closed this for inserts/updates **by
construction at the writer layer**: insert and update batches accumulate
in memory; no Lance HEAD advance happens during op execution; one
`stage_*` + `commit_staged` per touched table runs at end-of-query, and
only after every op succeeded. A failed op leaves Lance HEAD untouched
on the staged tables, so the next mutation proceeds normally with no
drift to reconcile.

The cancellation case (future drop mid-mutation) inherits the same
guarantee — the in-memory accumulator evaporates with the dropped task
and no Lance write was ever issued.

Delete-touching mutations now inherit the same guarantee (MR-A). Deletes
accumulate as predicates and stage via `stage_delete` at end-of-query, so a
delete cascade that fails mid-way advances no Lance HEAD — the same
"untouched on failure" property as inserts/updates. The old narrow inline
window (and the retry/`cleanup` workaround it required) is gone. The
parse-time D₂ rule keeps inserts/updates from coexisting with deletes in one
query as a deliberate boundary (see the D₂ section above), so a mutation is
always purely constructive or purely destructive.
