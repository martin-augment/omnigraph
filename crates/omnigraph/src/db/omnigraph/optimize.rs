//! Lance compaction + version cleanup exposed at the graph level.
//!
//! Lance accumulates many small `.lance` fragment files per table over the
//! life of a graph: each `write`, `load`, and `change` op appends one or more
//! fragments and a new manifest. Over long timescales this hurts open times
//! and S3 object counts without improving anything.
//!
//! Two dials:
//!
//! * `optimize_all_tables` — Lance `compact_files` on every table. Rewrites
//!   small fragments into fewer large ones, then **publishes the compacted
//!   version to the `__manifest`** so the manifest's `table_version` tracks the
//!   compacted Lance HEAD (reads pin the manifest version, so without the
//!   publish compaction would be invisible to readers and would break the
//!   HEAD-vs-manifest precondition of schema apply / strict writes). Compaction
//!   is content-preserving (Lance `Operation::Rewrite` "reorganizes data
//!   without semantic modification"), so old fragments remain reachable via
//!   older manifest versions until `cleanup` runs.
//! * `cleanup_all_tables` — Lance `cleanup_old_versions` on every table.
//!   Removes manifests (and their unique fragments) older than the configured
//!   retention. Destructive to version history — callers should gate this
//!   behind an explicit confirm flag at the CLI layer.
//!
//! Both walk every node + edge table on the `main` branch. Run branches
//! are ephemeral by design so we do not optimize them.
